            <h5>1.difference between local storage and session storage</h5>
            <p>Ans:localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same.The one major difference between localStorage
                and sessionStorage is the expiration date. Both have the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</li>
                <li>The values stored may only be strings.</li>
                <li>They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Local Storage // Local Storage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even
                if
                the domain is
                opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no
                expiration.</p>
            <p>Session Storage // Session Storage is cleared when the page session ends. A page
                session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new
                window, this creates a new session and new storage.</p>

            <h5>1.difference between Global scope vs Block scope</h5>
            <p>Global Scope Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

                Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

                Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block</p>

            <p>Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops,
                are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the
                curly braces are called as within block scope</p>
            <span>let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular
                block.</span>
