            <h5>1.difference between local storage and session storage</h5>
            <p>Ans:localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same.The one major difference between localStorage
                and sessionStorage is the expiration date. Both have the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</li>
                <li>The values stored may only be strings.</li>
                <li>They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Local Storage // Local Storage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even
                if
                the domain is
                opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no
                expiration.</p>
            <p>Session Storage // Session Storage is cleared when the page session ends. A page
                session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new
                window, this creates a new session and new storage.</p>

            <h5>2.difference between Global scope vs Block scope</h5>
            <p>Global Scope Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.Global variables can be
                accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block</p>

            <p>Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops,
                are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the
                curly braces are called as within block scope..let & const are also called as block scope that is they
                are accessible within that particular
                block.</p>

            <h5>3.What is an event loop in JavaScript ?</h5>
            <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on
                a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end</p>

            <p>The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a
                function is finished, it is popped from the stack.</p>
            <p>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                execution.</p>
            <p>Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser.
                Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.</p>
